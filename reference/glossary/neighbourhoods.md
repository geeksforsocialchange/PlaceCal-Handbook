# Neighbourhoods

Neighbourhoods are a geographical region in PlaceCal (e.g. District or Ward).&#x20;

PlaceCal sites which are place-based can be referred to as Neighbourhood sites. These sites are formed around a place-based community. They include everything within a specific geographical region, so are often quite narrowly focused (e.g. a single District). They usually include a much broader range of events than [partnership sites](partnerships.md), because the only criteria for inclusion is geographical location.
