# Districts

Districts are a geographical boundary which PlaceCal uses to work out which PlaceCal sites a Partner should appear on. PlaceCal uses data from the UK census office to determine these boundaries, retrieved in 2019. **There are currently no plans to update these boundaries when they change.**&#x20;

Districts are the second-smallest jurisdiction PlaceCal is configured to handle (after Wards) and usually refers to an area the size of a town or small city. In bigger cities like London, Districts relate to boroughs.&#x20;
