# Organisers

Organisers are the people who support Partners and Partner admins. They are volunteers or community development workers who make connections with prospective partners and help them put all of the information about their organisation into PlaceCal. Organisers can create Partners in PlaceCal, create Partner admin accounts, and are available for support. They will usually be someone who is embedded in the community that the PlaceCal site serves, who most people using PlaceCal in that community will know.

You might see occasional references to [**Neighbourhood admins**](user-roles/neighbourhood-admins.md) or [**Partnership admins**](user-roles/partnership-admins.md). They’re both types of Organiser, and you don’t need to worry about the difference if you’re not a PlaceCal developer. Organisers are usually also [**Site admins**](user-roles/site-admins.md).&#x20;
