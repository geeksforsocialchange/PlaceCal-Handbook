# Events

Events are a key part of how PlaceCal functions. Event data is imported into PlaceCal and displayed on Partner pages and PlaceCal sites.

Events are automatically displayed on PlaceCal sites. Events will show on sites when:

* The event’s Calendar belongs to a Partner who is shown on that site.
* The event’s address is within a Neighbourhood that is shown on that site (and it’s a [place-based site](neighbourhoods.md)).
* The event’s address matches the name and postcode of a Partner who is shown on that site.

Events can be connected to Partners in two ways:

* They are automatically connected to the Partner the Calendar belongs to. This Partner is shown on an event as being the **Event organiser.**
* They will be optionally connected to a Partner if they have the Partner’s name and postcode saved in their address, and if that Partner has consented to [event matching](../../how-to/configure-a-partner.md#event-matching). By default, Partners will not have event matching enabled, but Partners can opt into this by ticking this **Can be assigned events** box in the [Partner settings](../../how-to/configure-a-partner.md). Events will only be matched to Partners whose name is found in the events’ address, who have the same postcode as the event, and have consented to event matching.
