# Sites

Sites are individual PlaceCal instances (like`hulme.placecal.org`) which community members use to find event and Partner information. Each site shows information about the PlaceCal neighbourhood or partnership including the contact information for that community’s Organiser. Sites can come in a few different flavours – we originally split them strictly between place-based ([Neighbourhoods](neighbourhoods.md)) and interest-based ([Partnerships](partnerships.md)) but as PlaceCal has evolved this distinction has become less useful.&#x20;
