# Calendars

Calendars are event calendars run by Partners, which PlaceCal uses to import event listings to PlaceCal sites. Calendars are powered by a partner’s existing event management software such as Google Calendar, Outlook 365, or Eventbrite (there’s a full list of things we support under [Supported Calendar sources](../supported-calendar-sources/)). PlaceCal can work with most calendars that produce [computer-readable](../../explanation/structured-and-unstructured-data.md) event data.&#x20;

Calendars are associated with Partners, and information about events which has been imported from a Calendar is displayed on a Partner's public-facing PlaceCal page.
