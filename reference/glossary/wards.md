# Wards

Wards are a geographical boundary which PlaceCal uses to work out which PlaceCal sites a Partner should appear on. PlaceCal uses data from the UK census office to determine these boundaries, retrieved in 2019. **There are currently no plans to update these boundaries when they change.**&#x20;

Wards are the smallest jurisdiction PlaceCal is configured to handle and relates to the electoral wards used in local elections in the UK.&#x20;
