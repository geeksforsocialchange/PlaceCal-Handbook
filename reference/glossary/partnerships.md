# Partnerships

Partnerships are a specific type of PlaceCal site (e.g. `trans-dimension.placecal.org`) which are formed around an interest-based community. They’re more specific than a place-based or Neighbourhood site and might be something like ‘all of the trans-led and trans-involving events in this area’ or ‘all of the experimental music events in this region’.
