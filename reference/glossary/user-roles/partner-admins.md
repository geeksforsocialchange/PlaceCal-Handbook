# Partner admins

Partner admins are the people who update information directly in PlaceCal on behalf of a Partner. These are the people who have direct contact with the Organiser of the PlaceCal Site theyâ€™re a part of.

To become a Partner admin, a User's PlaceCal account needs to be associated with a Partner. You can check the Partner admins for any given Partner on the [**Edit Partner**](../../../how-to/configure-a-partner.md#partner-admins) page.&#x20;

If you would like to become a Partner admin and add your group or organisation's activity to PlaceCal, either get in touch with the Organiser of your PlaceCal site (contact information can be found on the homepage of your community's PlaceCal site) or [contact the PlaceCal team](mailto:support@placecal.org).&#x20;
