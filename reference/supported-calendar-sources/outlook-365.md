# Outlook 365

To import events from an Outlook 365 calendar PlaceCal needs its iCal/.ics link. This should be entered in the URL field when [adding a Calendar ](../../how-to/add-a-calendar.md)to PlaceCal.&#x20;

To find an Outlook 365 calendar's iCal/.ics link, go to the **Calendar publishing** section of the Outlook Calendar **Options.**

This generates an iCal feed, so see [iCal (generic)](ical-generic.md) for more information on how PlaceCal handles iCal sources.&#x20;
