# Airtable

Airtable has an [official guide](https://support.airtable.com/docs/integrating-airtable-with-external-calendar-applications) for creating iCal feeds. You should use the **iCal subscription link** in the URL field when [adding a Calendar](../../how-to/add-a-calendar.md) to PlaceCal.&#x20;

This generates an iCal feed, so see [iCal (generic)](ical-generic.md) for more information on how PlaceCal handles iCal sources.&#x20;
