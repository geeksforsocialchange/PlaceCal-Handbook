# Meetup

PlaceCal supports importing events directly from Meetup URLs.&#x20;

Sample URL: `https://www.meetup.com/qas-agile-learning-culture-meetup-group`

You can paste Meetup URLs into the URL field when [adding a calendar](../../how-to/add-a-calendar.md) to PlaceCal. It should auto-detect the Meetup link and import the Meetup group's events automatically.&#x20;

## Information PlaceCal imports from Meetup

* Unique ID&#x20;
* Event title
* Description
* Start time and date
* End time and date (calculated by adding the event duration to the start date)&#x20;
* Address
* URL&#x20;
* Online address (if it's an online event)&#x20;
