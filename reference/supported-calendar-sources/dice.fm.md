# Dice.fm

PlaceCal supports importing events directly from Dice venue pages.&#x20;

Sample URL: `https://dice.fm/venue/lido-9dan`

You can paste venue URLs into the URL field when [adding a calendar](../../how-to/add-a-calendar.md) to PlaceCal. It should auto-detect the Dice link and import the events automatically.&#x20;

Dice.fm uses JSON-LD, so see [JSON-LD (generic)](json-ld-generic.md) for more information on how PlaceCal handles JSON-LD sources.
