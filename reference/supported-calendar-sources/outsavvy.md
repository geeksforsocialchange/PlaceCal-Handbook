# OutSavvy

PlaceCal supports importing events directly from OutSavvy organiser URLs.&#x20;

Sample URL: `https://www.outsavvy.com/organiser/sappho-events`

You can paste OutSavvy URLs into the URL field when [adding a calendar](../../how-to/add-a-calendar.md) to PlaceCal. It should auto-detect the OutSavvy link and import the organiser's events automatically.&#x20;

Outsavvy uses JSON-LD, so see [JSON-LD (generic)](json-ld-generic.md) for more information on how PlaceCal handles JSON-LD sources.
