# iCloud Calendar

iCloud Calendar is the default calendar associated with iCloud accounts. If you have an iCloud account (which you do if you use any Apple devices) you have an iCloud calendar!&#x20;

You can access iCloud calendars using Apple's default Calendar app, which is installed by default on most Apple devices.&#x20;

To import events from an iCloud calendar, PlaceCal needs the calendar's share link which begins `webcal://`. This should be entered in the URL field when [adding a Calendar ](../../how-to/add-a-calendar.md)to PlaceCal.&#x20;

To get the calendar's share URL on a Macbook or iMac, find the name of the calendar you'd like to share in the list of calendars on the left of the Calendar app. If there's no list of calendars, click the button with the icon of a calendar at the top left to show them. You should then right click on the name of the calendar you'd like to share, and choose **Share calendar** from the menu. In the pop-up, check the box labelled **Public calendar**. Navigate away from the menu and then right click on the calendar again. You should now see an option labelled **Copy URL to Clipboard**. Choose this option, and paste it into the URL field when [adding a Calendar](../../how-to/add-a-calendar.md) to PlaceCal.&#x20;

If you don't see the option to **Copy URL to Clipboard** try choosing the option labelled **Sharing Settings**. This should display the URL beginning `webcal://` which you can then highlight and copy.&#x20;

This generates an iCal feed, so see [iCal (generic)](ical-generic.md) for more information on how PlaceCal handles iCal sources.&#x20;
