# Introduction

PlaceCal is a community calendar software [designed to work with communities](explanation/community-technology-partnerships.md) to have greater visibility and agency over their events and information. It works through PlaceCal Organisers embedded in communities who connect grassroots groups, organisations and social initiatives (which we refer to as Partners) with PlaceCal, building on the tools they're already using.&#x20;

PlaceCal is designed to reduce the admin burden on Partners by pulling information from places it's already being published, [working with common calendar and ticketing platforms](reference/supported-calendar-sources/) to stay up to date. It increases access and visibility of community activity by presenting event and Partner information in a clear format which doesn't require a login and is sorted chronologically. PlaceCal is designed to make it as easy and quick as possible to find out what's happening in your community, while [resisting the capture and funneling of community infrastructure into big tech walled gardens](explanation/resisting-walled-gardens-and-big-tech-silos.md).&#x20;

PlaceCal is developed and maintained by [Geeks for Social Change](https://gfsc.studio) and Place Health Technology CIC, largely focusing on communities based in the UK (for now).&#x20;

## Using this documentation

This documentation has been collated to support [Partner admins](reference/glossary/user-roles/partner-admins.md) or [Organisers](reference/glossary/organisers.md) in using PlaceCal. It also provides an overview as to how the software works for those who aren't yet working with PlaceCal, but are interested in using it in their community.&#x20;

**If you'd like to start using PlaceCal in your community**, [get in touch](mailto:support@placecal.org), or check our[ list of existing PlaceCal sites](https://placecal.org/find-placecal) to see if there's already one where you are.

For developers of other software interested on integrating with PlaceCal, there is also a section on using the [PlaceCal API](broken-reference).&#x20;

Definitions of key terminology used in PlaceCal can be found in the [Glossary](reference/glossary/).&#x20;
