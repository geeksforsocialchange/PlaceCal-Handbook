# Add a User

To add a User either click the **Add New User** button at the top of the Dashboard or the **Add new partner admin** button under **Connected entities** on a Partner's settings page. Depending on your account permissions, you may not be able to add a new User.

Ideally all Partners will have a Partner admin, someone who can act on behalf of that Partner who has access to PlaceCal in order to edit and update information about said Partner. If a Partner admin is not present, the Partner's information can be edited by the PlaceCal Organiser who added them.&#x20;

The only mandatory field on the **New User** page is their email address. When saved, this will send an email to the address entered with a link to set up their own PlaceCal User account.&#x20;

Depending on the permissions your account has, you will be able to associate the new User with **Partners**, **Neighbourhoods**, **Partnerships** and/or a **Role**. Fields will appear blank if you are not able to edit them.&#x20;

If you think you should have different account permissions, get in touch with the Organiser of your PlaceCal site (contact information can be found on the homepage of your PlaceCal site) or [contact the PlaceCal team](mailto:support@placecal.org).&#x20;
