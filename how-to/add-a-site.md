# Add a Site

Users with root access are able to add new PlaceCal sites. If you don't have root access, you'll need to talk to the PlaceCal team.&#x20;

To add a new site click the **Add New Site** button. This can be found at the top of the **Sites** page.&#x20;

If you can't see the **Add New Site** button, you may not have the correct account permissions.&#x20;

If you think you should have different account permissions, get in touch with the Organiser of your PlaceCal site (contact information can be found on the homepage of your PlaceCal site) or [contact the PlaceCal team](mailto:support@placecal.org).

When you click **Add New Site** you will be brought to the **Create a new Site** page. This has the same fields as found on the [Configure a Site](configure-a-site.md) page.&#x20;
