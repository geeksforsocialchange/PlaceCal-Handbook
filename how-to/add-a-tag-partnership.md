# Add a Tag (Partnership)

Users with root access are able to add new **Partnerships**, which the PlaceCal interface handles as a **Tag**. If you don't have root access, you'll need to talk to the PlaceCal team.&#x20;

To add a new Tag, click the **Add New Tag** button. This can be found at the top of the Tags page.&#x20;

If you can't see the Add New Tag button, you may not have the correct account permissions.&#x20;

If you think you should have different account permissions, get in touch with the Organiser of your PlaceCal site (contact information can be found on the homepage of your PlaceCal site) or [contact the PlaceCal team](mailto:support@placecal.org).

When you click **Add new Tag** you will be brought to the **Create a New Tag** page.&#x20;

## Basic information

### Name

Enter the name of the tag

### Slug

Enter the slug, which will be the URL where the tag is accessible. This should be all lowercase, with no spaces, using hyphens between words. Ideally it should be the same as the name of the tag, unless the name is very long.&#x20;

### Description

Enter a description of the tag

### System tag&#x20;

When adding Partnership tags, leave this box unchecked.

### Type

Choose Category, Facility or Partnership. This cannot be edited once selected. You will likely not need to add Facility or Category tags.&#x20;

### Tagged Partners&#x20;

Choose which Partners will be assigned this tag, if they already exist in PlaceCal.&#x20;

### Assigned Users&#x20;

Choose which Users will have permission to assign this tag. Ensure you choose the Organiser of any site which will use this tag, if it's a Partnership tag.
