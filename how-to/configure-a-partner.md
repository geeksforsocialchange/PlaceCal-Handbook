# Configure a Partner

To configure a Partner you'll need to navigate to the **Edit Partner** page.&#x20;

If you're in the process of adding a new Partner, you should end up on this page after you save a Partner for the first time. Otherwise, go to the Partners tab on the left hand side and choose the Partner you'd like to edit from the list which appears. Click on the name of the Partner to go to the **Edit Partner** page.&#x20;

You can also get here from the Dashboard if you edited or added the Partner you'd like to edit recently.&#x20;

**Partner admins** should be able to access and configure these settings using their own PlaceCal User account.&#x20;

Some of the fields on this page might appear differently (or not appear at all) depending on the permissions your User account has.  If you think you should have different account permissions, get in touch with the Organiser of your PlaceCal site (contact information can be found on the homepage of your PlaceCal site) or [contact the PlaceCal team](mailto:support@placecal.org).&#x20;

## Basic Information&#x20;

This section is for basic information about a Partner which will be shown to the public on any PlaceCal sites this Partner appears on.&#x20;

### Name

This information is initially set on the **New Partner** page, as it's a key part of how PlaceCal operates. More information on how to configure these settings is on the [**Add a Partner**](add-a-partner.md) page of this documentation.&#x20;

### Summary

This is a short description which should use one to two sentences (max) to describe what the Partner does. It should stick to the most important things someone might need to know about the Partner, for example a knitting group for women in Norwich who meet every month might set their summary to something like `Monthly knitting group for women in Norwich to meet, knit, and natter!`. This information is displayed in the list of Partners on any PlaceCal site this Partner appears on.&#x20;

### Description

This is space for a longer description which goes into more detail, which appears on the Partner's public PlaceCal page. The aforementioned knitting group might use this space to talk in more depth about the kinds of projects members usually bring, if there are supplies provided or if attendees should bring their own, and if they ever organise one-off events like craft fairs.&#x20;

### Accessibility Information&#x20;

If a Partner has an accessibility statement they should paste it here.&#x20;

We recommend Partners use this space to talk about the general accessibility of their events. If they are based in a fixed location, they should use this space to talk in detail about the accessibility of that location. This can be information about the physical details of the site (is there level access? If there are steps, how many? Are there accessible toilets on site?), logistics in accessing the site (nearest station and other public transport options, parking), if there is a separate quiet space, and any precautions the organisers have in place against transmission of airborne pathogens (if masks are required, if air filtration is present).&#x20;

Geeks for Social Change created a guide for the [Trans Dimension](https://transdimension.uk) (a PlaceCal site which highlights events by and for trans people) with Gendered Intelligence and the Greater Manchester Coalition of Disabled People called [_The Trans Dimension Guide to Inclusive Events_](https://gfsc.studio/project/guide-to-inclusive-events/)_._ It contains recommendations on things to consider when putting on events to include both trans and disabled people, as well as a questionnaire Partners can fill to generate a comprehensive accessibility statement.

### Image

This image is used to illustrate the Partner's PlaceCal page. It should be something which represents the Partner, for example a logo (if they have one) or an image from one of their events.&#x20;

## Place

This information is initially set on the **New Partner** page, as it's a key part of how PlaceCal operates. More information on how to configure these settings is on the [**Add a Partner**](add-a-partner.md) page of this documentation.&#x20;

## Online

These links will display on a Partner's public PlaceCal page if entered.&#x20;

### Website address

Add a web address for this Partner, if they have one. Enter the full address including `https://`.&#x20;

### Facebook link

Add a Facebook page for this Partner, if they have one. Enter the slug from this Partner's Facebook page (everything after the `/` in the URL).&#x20;

### Twitter handle

Add a Twitter handle for this Partner, if they have one. Enter the Partner's Twitter/X username.&#x20;

### Instagram handle

Add an Instagram handle for this Partner, if they have one. Enter the Partner's Instagram username.&#x20;

## Contact Information

Contact information is used both by PlaceCal staff and Organisers and the public who might need more information or to ask a question about an event or Partner. We ask for both public and private contact information where possible to cover these use cases. &#x20;

### Public Contact

Enter contact information the public can use to contact the Partner in the case that they need further information or have a question about events the Partner is sharing on PlaceCal. This information is visible on the Partner's public PlaceCal page.&#x20;

### Partnership Contact&#x20;

If different from the public contact information, enter contact information that PlaceCal staff and Organisers can use to contact the Partner. This information is _not_ visible on the Partner's public PlaceCal page.&#x20;

## Opening times

Set opening times for this Partner, if they have both a fixed location and regular opening times. These are displayed to the public so should be kept up-to-date where possible.&#x20;

## Tags

**Facilities** tags are used to highlight Partners which provide certain amenities. If you add a Facilities tag to your Partner, it will appear under that heading on the homepage of any PlaceCal site they appear on.

**Categories** tags appear in the filtering options when looking at the list of Partners on PlaceCal sites. They can be used to sort through the Partners on a site, which is useful for members of the public using PlaceCal to find events relevant to them. They can only be set at the Partner level, not on a per-event basis.&#x20;

**Partnership** tags are used by PlaceCal staff and Organisers to add Partners to specific Partnerships. You might not see this field, depending on the permissions your User account has.&#x20;

## Event matching

Event matching is a way of connecting events to a PlaceCal Partner, even if they weren't originally uploaded to that Partner's PlaceCal Calendar(s). This can be useful when a Partner runs a space which other Partners operate out of, for example a large venue with multiple units occupied by Partners, which also runs its own events. Partners should check **Can be assigned events** if they want events from other Partners to be able to be matched to their address and appear on their PlaceCal Partner page.&#x20;

This used to be PlaceCal's default behaviour, but has since been changed to an opt-in model. Partners who have been on PlaceCal since prior to Spring 2024 should check this setting is configured to their preference.&#x20;

## Connected entities&#x20;

### Calendars

This section should display any connected Calendars. Clicking the button **Add a new calenda**r should take you to the [**Create a new calendar** ](add-a-calendar.md)page. If there is nothing in this section, this Partner is not currently importing any events to PlaceCal sites.

### Partner admins

Partner admins are Users who have permission to edit this Partner's settings. Clicking the **Add a new partner admin** button will take you to the [**New User**](add-a-user.md) page.
