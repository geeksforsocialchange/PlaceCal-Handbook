# Google Calendar

Google Calendar is the default calendar associated with Google accounts. If you have a Gmail address, you have a Google calendar! You can access it by going to [calendar.google.com](https://calendar.google.com).&#x20;

To import events from a Google calendar PlaceCal needs the **Public address in iCal format**. This should be entered in the URL field when [adding a Calendar ](../../how-to/add-a-calendar.md)to PlaceCal.&#x20;

You can find the **Public address in iCal format** on each Google calendar's Settings page under the subheading **Integrate calendar**. Note that the calendar needs to be set to **Make available to public** in order for PlaceCal to be able to access its events.&#x20;

Instructions on setting up a Google Calendar can be found in [Google's official documentation](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37095?hl=en).&#x20;

This generates an iCal feed, so see [iCal (generic)](ical-generic.md) for more information on how PlaceCal handles iCal sources.&#x20;
